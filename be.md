	- 'result' is usually what is accomplished but also **what was learned**

- Describe a time you had a conflict iwth a team member/ describe a time where you were the first one to speak up about somethign

	- highly recommend use the STAR method
	- talk about how you solved the conflict, show problem-solving skills

- Why [company]?

	- do the research
	- if targeting culture, say something specific (work-life balance, transparency, etc)
	- why do you like their product/industry
	- pro-tip: if you've had a chat/previous interview with someone else for this company talk about something positive that person mentioned
	- if you use their product, talk about that

##### Somewhat common

	- This one was an unexpected question but I got this asked twice

##### Rare

### Other tips
- Don't use "we", make sure you specify what exactly **you** contributed
- prepare 1-2 answers for each question
- practice speaking your answers out loud, don't read off a script and try to always look for room to improvise
- questions to ask towards the end of the interview, always look for follow up questions
